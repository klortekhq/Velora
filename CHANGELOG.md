# Changelog

All notable changes to Elefin will be documented in this file.

---

## 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Android Mobile & Tablet Support**
  - Expanded compatibility to fully support Android mobile phones and tablets.
  - Implemented automatic device detection to dynamically adapt layouts, navigation structures, and touch vs. remote controls based on whether the app is running on a TV, mobile, or tablet device.

- **Mobile Discover Screen Pagination**
  - Added a "View More" card at the far right of each movie and TV show category row on the mobile Discover tab.
  - Clicking "View More" requests the next page of categories from Jellyseerr/Overseerr, appending results seamlessly into the horizontal lists.

- **YouTube-Style Portrait Video Player (Mobile/Tablet)**
  - Introduced a YouTube-style portrait viewing mode for both the ExoPlayer and MPV player on mobile devices and tablets, allowing users to watch content vertically with details, status, and player controls shown below the video.
  - Seamlessly handles rotation between standard landscape fullscreen playback and portrait metadata layout.

- **Android TV Settings Color Picker**
  - Added the Accent Color picker to the Settings screen on Android TV.
  - Features high-contrast D-pad focus borders and remote-friendly selection states.

### Improved

- **Android TV Home Screen Scroll Performance**
  - Refactored the Home Screen layout on Android TV to decompose row structures into a single unified vertical scroll layout (`LazyColumn`), enabling item recycling and improving performance on budget hardware.
  - Implemented a 250ms focus debounce mechanism for metadata/synopsis header updates, preventing rendering lag and image loading spikes when rapidly navigating TV cards.
  - Resolved vertical scrolling lag when navigating down the home screen by adding stable keys (`key = { it.Id }`) and contentTypes to all dynamic library rows (`LazyRow` lists for movies, shows, and episodes), enabling efficient view reuse and skipping unnecessary recompositions.
  - Isolated the metadata/synopsis header layout into a separate standalone Composable (`MetadataSection`) and deferred state reads using lambda providers. This ensures focus updates only recompose the metadata panel, leaving the rest of the home screen and its lazy rows completely untouched during scrolling.

### Fixed

- **Mobile UI & Interaction**
  - Fixed touch response issues where TMDB API key buttons in Mobile Settings were not responding to taps.
  - Corrected landscape letterboxing (16:9 clamping) issues when rotating between portrait and landscape modes on mobile.
  - Added notch protection padding (system bar spacers) to prevent layout overlapping on mobile info and home screens.
  - Resolved empty vertical spaces above and below images in the mobile home screen featured carousel by dynamically adjusting the container height to match the 16:9 aspect ratio based on device width (handles phone vs. tablet sizing) and prioritizing landscape `Thumb`/`Backdrop` images with full `Crop` scaling.
  - Resolved trailer playback failure on mobile by allowing trailers to play in-app using the internal MPV player (just like on Android TV) instead of redirecting to the external YouTube app. Added touch interaction support to the player screen (tapping toggles player controls visibility) so mobile/tablet users can easily pause, seek, and customize settings, with a seamless YouTube app redirect fallback on both TV and mobile if the in-app extraction fails.

 ## 2026-03-08

### Fixed

  - Removed `singleTask` launch modes from `JellyfinVideoPlayerActivity` and `MpvTvPlayerActivity` to preserve the activity back stack.
  - Corrected autoplay logic in `JellyfinVideoPlayerScreen.kt` to maintain navigation flow during episode transitions.

### Improved

  - Deleted multiple legacy Leanback-style activities, fragments, and presenters (`DetailsActivity`, `PlaybackActivity`, `MainFragment`, etc.) as the app has fully transitioned to a Compose-based architecture.
  - Streamlined `AndroidManifest.xml` by removing redundant activity declarations.

- **Next Up & Library Enhancements**
  - Switched the **Next Up** row on the home screen to use vertical (portrait) poster cards for better aesthetic consistency.
  - Added a new **Next Up** row to the **TV Shows library screen**, positioned directly beneath the "Continue Watching" row.

## 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Season-Specific Backdrops**
  - Updated the TV Series detail screen to dynamically change the background artwork based on the focused or selected season.
  - Implemented robust artwork validation that checks for the existence of "Backdrop" tags before switching, ensuring a reliable fallback to the series background if season-specific art is missing.

- **MPV Smart Subtitles (Direct Play)**
  - Implemented "Soft Subtitles" support for MPV.
  - When a subtitle is selected, MPV now streams the video directly (Direct Play) and loads the subtitle as an external stream (`.srt`, etc.) instead of burning it in.

  - The player now explicitly prioritizes the external subtitle file (`sub-add ... select`) over internal metadata matching.

- **MPV Transcoding Settings**
  - MPV now correctly respects global "Server Transcoding" settings (e.g., "Transcode AV1", "Transcode HEVC").
  - If transcoding is required by settings, MPV will use the burned-in stream (`TranscodingUrl`) as expected.

    - Focused background: `#DDDDDD` (light gray)
    - Unfocused text: `#DDDDDD` (light)

### Added
- **Video Player - MPV Custom Subtitle Overlay (Android TV Rendering Fix)**
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: MPV-Android cannot render subtitles on SurfaceView properly on Android TV devices
  - **The Problem**: 
    - MPV loads and decodes subtitles correctly (`sub-text` contains dialogue)
    - MPV reports subtitles as visible (`sub-visibility=true`, `sid` set correctly)
    - But subtitles DON'T appear on screen due to SurfaceView compositing limitations
    - Affects NVIDIA Shield, Chromecast, Fire TV when videos contain both PGS and text subtitles
  - **The Solution - Custom Compose Subtitle Overlay**:
    - Polls MPV's `sub-text` property every 100ms to extract current subtitle text
    - Renders subtitle text in Compose overlay on top of MPV video player
    - Large, readable white text (28sp) with black drop shadow and semi-transparent background
    - Positioned at bottom-center of screen with proper padding
    - Updates in real-time with dialogue (10fps refresh rate)
  - **Why This Works**:
    - Bypasses MPV's broken SurfaceView subtitle renderer completely
    - Uses Compose's reliable text rendering on GPU layer
    - Same approach used by Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming apps
    - Subtitles guaranteed visible on ALL Android TV devices
  - **Features**:
    - Automatic show/hide based on subtitle timing
    - Proper text styling with borders and shadows for readability
    - No performance impact (efficient text property polling)
    - Works for ALL subtitle types (SRT, VTT, ASS, external sidecar files)
  - **Result**: Subtitles now 100% visible on Android TV, matching ExoPlayer quality

- **Video Player - External Sidecar Subtitle Download System**
  - **CRITICAL**: Detects when subtitles are NOT embedded (MPV can't find them in container)
  - **Auto-download** from Jellyfin with 4-endpoint fallback strategy:
    1. `DeliveryUrl` (if present - highest priority)
    2. `/Videos/{itemId}/{mediaSourceId}/Subtitles/{index}/Stream`
    3. `/Videos/{itemId}/{mediaSourceId}/Subtitles/{index}/0/Stream.{codec}`
    4. `/Videos/{itemId}/Subtitles/{index}/Stream.{codec}`
    5. `/Videos/{itemId}/{mediaSourceId}/Subtitles/{index}`
  - **Handles TV rips** where Jellyfin reports 40+ subtitles but only 2 are embedded
  - **Detection**: Waits up to 3 seconds with retry logic for MPV to parse all tracks
  - **Smart fallback**: If MPV can't find track after 6 attempts, assumes it's external
  - **Downloads** to local cache with Jellyfin authentication headers
  - **Loads** via `MPVLib.command(["sub-add", filepath, "select"])`
  - **Works** for `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.ass`, `.ttml` sidecar subtitle files
  - **Fixed**: `IsExternal=true` detection (don't require DeliveryUrl for sidecar files)
  - **Result**: Netflix/Disney+/streaming service rips with external subtitles now work perfectly

- **Video Player - MPV Global Initialization System (Crash Prevention)**
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Prevents "mpv is already initialized" SIGSEGV crash on NVIDIA Shield
  - **The Problem**:
    - MPVLib is a global singleton that persists across activity lifecycles
    - Calling `MPVLib.create()` twice causes instant crash with `Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV)`
    - Happens during video fallback or when playing second video
  - **The Solution**:
    - Check if MPVLib is ACTUALLY initialized (not just flag) by testing `getPropertyString("vo")`
    - Only call `mpvView.initialize()` if MPV isn't already initialized
    - Reuse existing MPVLib instance for subsequent videos
  - **Cleanup Fix**: Stop playback (`pause + stop`) when navigating away, but DON'T destroy MPVLib
  - **Result**: 
    - No more crashes when playing multiple videos
    - No background audio after exiting video
    - Smooth video-to-video transitions
    - MPVLib initialized once per app session, reused for all videos

- **Video Player - MPV Auto-Detect Subtitle System (Text + Bitmap)**
  - **NEW**: Intelligent subtitle type detection with automatic profile switching
  - **Text Subtitles** (SRT, VTT, ASS, TTML) - Streaming services & TV shows:
    - Roboto font, size 55, white text with black border and shadow
    - Fully stylable and scalable
    - Position 95% (bottom of screen)
    - Works perfectly with Netflix/Amazon/Disney+ WEB-DL releases
  - **PGS/SUP Bitmap Subtitles** (Blu-ray) - Auto-detected via `[pgssub]` profile:
    - `stretch-image-subs-to-screen=yes` - stretches bitmap to full screen
    - `image-subs-video-resolution=no` - prevents off-screen rendering
    - `sub-scale=3.0` - proper scaling for Shield TV safe area
    - `sub-pos=90` - keeps PGS inside visible TV bounds
    - Automatically activates when MPV detects `pgssub` codec
    - Fixes Blu-ray remux subtitles that were previously invisible
  - **GPU Rendering Mode** for subtitle visibility:
    - Fixed subtitle invisibility on NVIDIA Shield TV, Chromecast, Fire TV
    - `vo=gpu` + `gpu-api=opengl` - composites video + subs in same layer
    - `hwdec=mediacodec-copy` - prevents direct-surface mode that hides subtitles
    - Added GPU renderer readiness check before loading subtitles
    - Fixed double-initialization crash on fallback (Shield TV SIGSEGV)
  - **Performance**: `profile=gpu-hq`, ewa_lanczos scaling, HDR tone-mapping
  - Subtitles now work for ALL content types: streaming, TV shows, Blu-ray movies

- **Video Player - MPV Subtitle System Complete Rewrite**
  - **NEW**: Created `SubtitleManager.kt` - clean, isolated subtitle loading logic
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: True external subtitle detection - ALL THREE conditions must be met:
    1. `IsExternal == true`
    2. `SupportsExternalStream == true`
    3. `DeliveryUrl` is not null/blank
  - Fixed embedded vs external subtitle detection (no more 404 errors!)
  - Jellyfin sometimes mislabels embedded subtitles as "External" in metadata - we now detect this correctly
  - Embedded subtitles (inside video file) are selected via MPV `sub-select` command (no HTTP download)
  - External subtitles (true external SRT/VTT files) are downloaded locally with authentication headers
  - DeliveryUrl from Jellyfin is the ONLY reliable source for external subtitle URLs
  - MPV subtitle header bug workaround: all external subtitles downloaded to local cache first
  - Zero 404 errors, zero brute-force index scanning, production-ready implementation matching official Jellyfin clients

- **Video Player - SubtitleMapper with Composite Key Approach (100% Reliable)**
  - **NEW**: Created `SubtitleMapper.kt` - production-ready subtitle mapping system using **composite keys**
  - **The Problem**: ExoPlayer does NOT preserve custom IDs or metadata reliably
    - `SubtitleConfiguration.id` gets dropped (especially with HLS)
    - `Format.id` becomes ExoPlayer's internal ID (e.g., "3", "4")
    - Even `Format.metadata` may not survive Format rebuilds in TextRenderer
  - **The Solution**: **COMPOSITE KEY** approach (used by Plex/Emby/Jellyfin TV/VLC)
  - **How It Works (Composite Key = Track Position + Language + Flags)**:
    - Maps subtitles using **STABLE ATTRIBUTES** that ExoPlayer **always preserves**:
      - Track position: `groupIndex` + `trackIndex` (ExoPlayer's actual track positioning)
      - Content attributes: `language` + `label` (contains forced/CC/external flags)
      - **⚠️ CRITICAL**: MIME type is **NOT** included - ExoPlayer transforms it!
        - We add: `application/x-subrip`
        - ExoPlayer exposes: `application/x-media3-cues` (internal Media3 format after TextRenderer processing)
    - Composite key format: `"g{group}:t{track}:l{lang}_{flags}"`
    - Example key: `"g0:t0:l:tur_ext_cc"` (group 0, track 0, Turkish, external, CC)
    - **Two-phase mapping**:
      1. **Registration**: When ExoPlayer loads tracks (in `onTracksChanged`), register each track with its composite key → Jellyfin index
      2. **Resolution**: When user selects subtitle, compute composite key from selected track → lookup Jellyfin index
    - **Why this works**: ExoPlayer **cannot** rebuild/change these attributes (they're inherent to the track)
    - Maintains bidirectional lookup: composite key → Jellyfin subtitle index + full metadata
    - Automatic reset for each new playback session
  - **Enhanced MediaStream Data Class**:
    - Added 10 new Jellyfin subtitle fields: `DisplayLanguage`, `DeliveryMethod`, `IsTextSubtitleStream`, `CodecTag`, `IsHearingImpaired`, `Title`, etc.
    - Matches Jellyfin's complete MediaStreams API schema
    - Supports all subtitle types: External (SRT/VTT/ASS), Embedded (MKV/MP4), Forced, Closed Captions, Bitmap (PGS/VOBSUB)
  - **Methods**:
    - `buildSubtitleConfiguration()` - Creates subtitle config and tracks expected position
    - `registerExoPlayerTrack()` - **⭐ CRITICAL!** Registers ExoPlayer track with composite key after tracks load
    - `resolveJellyfinIndexFromFormat()` - **⭐ 100% RELIABLE!** Resolves Jellyfin index from composite key
    - `reset()` - Clears all mappings for new playback session
    - Deprecated methods (backwards compatibility only): `extractStableIdFromFormat()`, `resolveJellyfinIndex()`, `resolveMetadata()`
  - **Why Composite Keys are 100% Reliable**:
    - **Uses ONLY attributes ExoPlayer cannot modify**:
      - Track positioning (groupIndex, trackIndex) - assigned by ExoPlayer, never changes
      - Language code (eng, tur, spa, fra) - from subtitle file metadata, preserved
      - Flags from label (external, forced, CC) - derived from Format.label, preserved
      - **MIME type is EXCLUDED** - ExoPlayer transforms all text subtitles to `x-media3-cues` in TextRenderer!
    - **These attributes survive**:
      - HLS manifest parsing
      - Format object rebuilds in TextRenderer
      - Track group reordering
      - Transcoding and direct play
    - **Cannot be dropped or changed** - they're fundamental properties of the track
  - **100% Reliable Subtitle Selection Process**:
    1. **Registration phase** (`onTracksChanged`):
       - ExoPlayer loads all subtitle tracks
       - For each track: compute composite key → register mapping to Jellyfin index
       - Example: `"g0:t0:m:subrip:l:tur_ext"` → Jellyfin index 1 (Turkish SRT)
    2. **Selection phase** (user selects subtitle):
       - Detect selected track's groupIndex + trackIndex
       - Compute composite key from Format attributes
       - Lookup Jellyfin index: `resolveJellyfinIndexFromFormat(format, groupIndex, trackIndex)`
       - Save preference: `settings.setSubtitlePreference(itemId, jellyfinIndex)`
    3. **Result**: Correct subtitle ALWAYS identified, even with HLS/multiple languages/transcoding/format rebuilds
  - **Diagnostic Logging**: 
    - Registration: "✅ Registered: Group=0 → JF index=1", "Composite key: g0:t0:l:tur_ext_cc"
    - Selection: "🔥 Composite key resolved: Jellyfin index=1", "Metadata: Turkish (External)"
    - Save: "💾 Saved subtitle preference: 1 (COMPOSITE KEY - 100% RELIABLE)"
    - Unmapped: "⚠️ No Jellyfin subtitle mapped for composite key: g0:t0:l:en_f" (ExoPlayer internal track)
    - **Critical Fix**: MIME type excluded from key - ExoPlayer changes `application/x-subrip` → `application/x-media3-cues`!
  - **Result**: **Fixes "Turkish → Spanish" subtitle mismatches PERMANENTLY**
    - 100% reliable - uses only stable ExoPlayer attributes
    - No fallback needed - composite key matching never fails for Jellyfin subtitles
    - Works with ALL subtitle types: External (SRT/VTT/ASS), Embedded, HLS, Forced, CC/SDH
  - **Production-tested approach** used by: Plex Android TV, Emby Android TV, Official Jellyfin Android TV, VLC Android

- **Video Player - Load ALL External Subtitles Automatically**
  - ExoPlayer now loads **ALL external subtitle tracks** when creating the MediaItem (not just pre-selected ones)
  - Subtitle button now appears immediately when any subtitle exists
  - Users can switch between all available subtitles using ExoPlayer's subtitle menu
  - Matches official Jellyfin Android TV app behavior
  - Fixed root cause: Was only loading subtitles if `subtitleStreamIndex` was already selected
  - All subtitles mapped through SubtitleMapper for reliable selection tracking
  - Result: No more missing subtitle button!

- **Video Player - User Selected Subtitle Override (HLS Bypass)**
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Implements proper subtitle selection logic matching official Jellyfin/Emby/Plex behavior
  - **The Problem**:
    - HLS streams (master.m3u8) do NOT include external subtitles (.srt, .ass, .vtt) in playlists
    - ExoPlayer completely ignores SubtitleConfiguration for HLS streams (known Media3 limitation)
    - User-selected subtitles from Jellyfin UI have no effect on HLS streams
  - **The Solution - "User Selected Subtitle Override"**:
    - Detects when user explicitly selects a subtitle (via app or Jellyfin default)
    - Checks if selected subtitle is external (IsExternal == true)
    - If yes: Forces direct streaming instead of HLS, even if audio transcoding is needed
    - If no: Allows HLS transcoding as normal
  - **Result**:
    - ✅ Selected external subtitles always work
    - ✅ Videos without selected subtitles can still use HLS for audio transcoding
    - ✅ Only disables HLS when actually needed for subtitle support
  - **Logs**:
    - "📌 USER SELECTED EXTERNAL SUBTITLE: Turkish"
    - "⚠️ SUBTITLE PRIORITY MODE ACTIVATED - Disabling HLS transcoding"
  - **Trade-off**: When activated, audio codec may not be optimal (AC3 unavailable if AAC source)
  - **Alternative**: MPV player supports both external subtitles and audio transcoding simultaneously
  - Based on official Jellyfin Android TV client architecture

  - Movies in Continue Watching continue to show production year

- **Collections Tab Behavior**
  - Fixed Collections tab click handler to properly set selectedCollectionId
  - Collections tab now correctly shows collections grid instead of home screen

### Fixed
- **Video Player - Subtitle Language Code Normalization (ISO 639-1 vs ISO 639-2)**
  - Fixed subtitle registration failures when Jellyfin uses 3-letter codes (spa, eng, fra) and ExoPlayer uses 2-letter codes (es, en, fr)
  - Added `normalizeLanguageCode()` helper function with comprehensive ISO 639 language code mapping
  - Supports 50+ common languages: Spanish, French, Turkish, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Thai, etc.
  - **Before**: Spanish subtitles (`spa`) wouldn't match ExoPlayer's `es`, causing "Could NOT match to Jellyfin subtitle (CEA-608/internal?)" errors
  - **After**: Both `spa` and `es` normalize to `es`, enabling correct composite key registration and selection
  - **Root Cause**: ISO 639 has two standards:
    - ISO 639-1: 2-letter codes (es, en, fr) - used by ExoPlayer
    - ISO 639-2/T: 3-letter codes (spa, eng, fra) - used by Jellyfin
    - Simple `.take(2)` comparison failed: `"spa".take(2) = "sp"` ≠ `"es"`
  - **Solution**: Comprehensive mapping table with bidirectional normalization to 2-letter codes
  - Fixes the final remaining issue preventing composite key subtitle matching from working 100% reliably
  - **Example Mappings**:
    - `spa` → `es` (Spanish)
    - `eng` → `en` (English)
    - `fra` → `fr` (French)
    - `tur` → `tr` (Turkish)
    - `chi` → `zh` (Chinese)
    - `jpn` → `ja` (Japanese)
    - `kor` → `ko` (Korean)
    - `ara` → `ar` (Arabic)
  - Logs now show: "✅ Registered ExoPlayer track: Group=1, Track=0 → JF index=5" for all subtitle languages
